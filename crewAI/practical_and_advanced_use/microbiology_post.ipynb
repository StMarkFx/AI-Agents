Economic growth is likely to decelerate in 2024 as the effects of monetary policy take a broader toll and post-pandemic tailwinds fade. We expect real GDP growth to walk the line between a slight expansion and contraction for much of next year, also known as a soft landing. After tracking to a better-than-expected 2.8% real GDP growth in 2023, we forecast a below-trend 0.7% pace of expansion in 2024. Among the major components of GDP, consumer spending is likely to rise at a more muted pace next year, while fiscal spending could swing from a positive contributor in 2023 to a modest drag. Notable drops in business investment and housing activity in 2023 set the foundation for improved performance in 2024, even if the outlook remains muted amid higher interest rates; 2023 strength in services\n",

      "below, the U.S. housing market is effectively frozen. Real residential investment tumbled at a 12% seasonally adjusted annual rate over the past six quarters. Meanwhile, home values rose 6% in 2023‚Äîto near all-time highs‚Äîamid tight supply and historically low vacancies. Given the already large drop in recent years, we think the housing market is one area of the economy that could perform better in 2024 than in 2023, even if trends remain soft in the near term. 8. Supply chain bottlenecks are mostly in the rearview, while global supply chain restructuring will take time. Over the past year, as inventory constraints and shipping costs have fallen, supply chain considerations have shifted from short-term tactics to longer-term strategies of minimizing costs while ensuring resiliency. Legislation passed in 2022 including the CHIPS and Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act provides incentive for certain strategic industries‚Äîincluding semiconductors and renewables‚Äîto onshore production. This has resulted in rising business investment in high-tech manufacturing structures over the past year. Bigger picture, we expect global supply chain adjustments to continue at a conservative pace, as even the simplest changes are both costly and complex. 9. Pressures on the commercial real estate sector are likely to intensify. The higher-for-longer interest rate environment and challenges among small and regional banks are resulting in tightening of lending standards and slowing slow growth. This is occurring across all loan types, but most acutely for the commercial real estate sector, where small and regional banks have meaningful exposure. With nearly $550 billion of maturing commercial real estate debt over the next year, losses are expected to mount for lenders and investors. While we do not expect this to be a systemic issue, reduced lending activity and potential investor losses could be an economic headwind. 10. Geopolitical risks will remain top of mind.

      "result that the US population is lower in 2029 than it is today. A total of US$1.35 trillion is cut from federal government spending, achieved through deep cuts to Medicaid transfers, social security payments, and income security programs, representing a big decrease in the living standards of millions of Americans. Overall, economic growth slows considerably to 1.6% in 2025 before the economy suffers an outright contraction of 2.1% in 2026, a recession of similar magnitude to those we experienced in 2020 and 2009. The economy is expected to run weaker for longer as rising trade tensions and the sustained enforcement of the new immigration policy keep consumption growth in the red for most of the forecast. Inflation also trends higher for longer, peaking at 3.7% in 2026 before easing gradually to 3% by the end of the forecast. With these inflationary pressures, we expect the Fed to enter a new rate hiking cycle in 2026 before again beginning to ease monetary policy in 2027. To some extent, the weaker economy in this scenario is not surprising: The stated purpose of tariffs is to re-shore manufacturing to the United States, but that process will take time, so any benefits of such a policy will not be felt during the next four years. The policy of mass deportations would likely have a profound effect on industries like agriculture and hospitality, where undocumented workers make up a significant share of the total workforce. Likewise, making deep cuts to government spending and transfers will always be a net negative to the macroeconomy in the short term.

In September, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.4% after a 0.2% rise in August. For the third quarter of 2024, overall real PCE rose 3.7% (at annual rates), stronger than the 2.8% growth recorded in the second quarter, with spending on goods, specifically durable\u001b[00m\n",

      "## Introduction to Carbon Sequestration\n",
      "\n",
      "Carbon sequestration refers to the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced from various activities, particularly by fossil fuel consumption, and storing it underground or using it for other purposes. This technology plays a vital role in mitigating climate change by reducing the amount of CO2 that enters the atmosphere. In recent years, the importance of carbon sequestration has gained significant traction due to international climate agreements and the urgent need to transition towards a more sustainable energy system.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Mechanisms of Carbon Sequestration\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three primary methods of carbon sequestration:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Biological Sequestration**: This involves capturing CO2 through natural processes such as photosynthesis in forests, soil, and vegetation. Enhancing the growth of woody plants or implementing sustainable land management practices can significantly increase carbon storage capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Geological Sequestration**: This method stores CO2 in deep geological formations, primarily in depleted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifers. The sequestered CO2 is injected under high pressure, where it becomes trapped by the impermeable rock layers above.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technological Sequestration**: This approach utilizes advanced technologies, such as direct air capture and enhanced weathering, to extract CO2 from the atmosphere and store it permanently or utilize it in industrial processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Benefits of Carbon Sequestration\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Climate Change Mitigation**: By reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, carbon sequestration serves as a critical tool in the fight against global warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Economic Opportunities**: Investments in carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies can lead to job creation in engineering, construction, and maintenance sectors, fostering economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Energy Security**: Carbon capture technologies offer cleaner alternatives to traditional energy generation, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting energy independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Developments in Carbon Capture Technology\n",
      "\n",
      "Carbon capture technology has evolved significantly in the last decade, making it more efficient and cost-effective. Recent innovations include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Improved Materials**: Advanced absorbing materials, such as metal-organic frameworks and novel amine solvents, have been developed to enhance CO2 capture rates and reduce energy consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Integration with Renewable Energy**: Carbon capture systems are increasingly being integrated with renewable energy sources, allowing excess energy from solar and wind to power capture processes, which further lowers overall carbon emissions in the energy sector.\n",
