President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated next week, has also pledged tax cuts, which would fuel economic growth.\"There's still more inflation-fighting work for the Fed to do, which is why it has shifted plans to more slowly reduce the still-restrictive federal funds rate,\" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.\"It will stand pat later this month, and may not resume cutting rates until it gets some clarity on the inflation pass-through of the tariffs that could begin rolling out next week.\"The consumer price index rose 0.4% last month, the largest gain since March, after climbing 0.3% in November, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said. A 2.6% jump in the cost of energy products accounted for more than 40% of the increase in the CPI. Energy prices, which had risen 0.2% in November, were boosted by a 4.4% surge in the cost of gasoline.Consumers also faced higher prices for food, which rose 0.3% after advancing 0.4% in November. Grocery store prices rose 0.3%, driven by increases in the costs of cereals and bakery products, meats, poultry and fish.Egg prices soared 3.2%, reflecting an avian flu outbreak that has reduced supply. They increased 36.8% year-on-year.In the 12 months through December, the CPI advanced 2.9%. That was the largest rise since July and followed a 2.7% increase in November. Some of the rise in the annual CPI rate reflected last year's low readings dropping out of the calculation. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI gaining 0.3% and rising 2.9% year-on-year.Consumer prices increased 2.9% in 2024, slowing from 4.1% in 2023. Progress bringing inflation back to its target recently hit a snag. Consumers' inflation expectations soared in January, with households concerned that tariffs would raise goods prices.\"Inflation improved meaningfully in 2024, although it did not slow enough to meet the Fed's target or satisfy consumers weary from the big cumulative price increases of the last few years,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank.FED ON HOLDNo rate cut is expected at the Fed's Jan. 28-29 policy meeting. Financial markets, however, increased bets on a rate reduction in June. The central bank launched its easing cycle in September and has lowered its benchmark overnight interest rate by 100 basis points to the current 4.25%-4.50% range.The last reduction was in December when policymakers also projected two rate cuts this year instead of the four they had forecast in September. The policy rate was hiked by 5.25 percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023.Stocks on Wall Street were higher, also cheered by strong bank earnings. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.Inflation gaugesExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.2% in December. The so-called core CPI had risen 0.3% for four straight months.Still, some details of the core CPI firmed last month. Owners' equivalent rent, a measure of the amount homeowners would pay to rent or earn from renting their property, rose 0.3% after advancing 0.2% in November.Airline fares surged 3.9%. But prices for hotel and motel rooms fell 1.0%. Healthcare costs edged up 0.1% amid marginal rises in the prices for physicians and hospital services.There were also increases in the costs of motor vehicle insurance, recreation and education. Services prices rose 0.3% for a second consecutive month.Used cars and trucks' prices increased 1.2%. Prescription medication prices were unchanged. New motor vehicles cost more as did apparel. Core goods prices edged up 0.1% after climbing 0.3% in November.In the 12 months through December, the core CPI increased 3.2% after advancing 3.3% in November.Some of the benign CPI components partially offset firmness in the PPI categories that feed into the core personal consumption expenditures price index, one of the inflation measures monitored by the Fed for monetary policy.Economists' estimates for December core inflation ranged from 0.14% to 0.174%. Core inflation edged up 0.1% in November. It was forecast increasing 2.8% year-on-year for a third straight month in December.\"While we welcomed a modest deceleration in core CPI ... the data all points to sticky inflation in both the service sector and in housing,\" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"This is not well aligned with arguments for near-term rate cuts as the aggregate demand driven by consumer spending continues to support economic growth.\" Sign up here.Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Andrea Ricci and Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabSuggested Topics:Macro MattersShareXFacebookLinkedinEmailLinkPurchase Licensing RightsRead NextMacro MatterscategoryUS retail sales exit 2024 with momentum; labor market on solid ground8:04 PM UTCMacro MatterscategoryECB's Lagarde moves markets with a frown, Draghi with a smile, study finds3:19 PM UTCMacro MatterscategoryUS weekly jobless claims increase; labor market conditions still healthy1:44 PM UTCMacro MatterscategoryECB accounts show case for gradual, cautious rate cuts1:31 PM UTCMarketsGlobal stock index outperforms Wall St, bond yields dip with rates in focusMarketscategory ¬∑ January 16, 2025 ¬∑ 9:41 PM UTC ¬∑ agoMSCI's global equities gauge rose on Thursday, while Wall Street indexes closed lower and U.S. Treasury yields fell after a mixed bag of economic data and Federal Reserve official comments suggesting more interest rate cuts on the horizon.MarketscategoryTSX posts one-week high, led by financials and utilities9:22 PM UTCMarketscategoryTariff-fuelled dollar gains pose global stagflation risks, BIS warns5:44 PM UTCMarketscategoryMost Gulf markets gain on Fed rate cuts, Gaza ceasefire1:37 PM UTCMarketscategoryBrazil economic activity beats forecasts in November despite monetary tightening12:52 PM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessMarketsSustainabilityLegalBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsSportsScienceLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabAdvertise with Us, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters and AI, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App (iOS), opens new tabDownload the App (Android), opens new tabNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world‚Äôs largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

The article highlights that US consumer prices increased by the most in nine months in December, driven by higher costs for energy goods. However, there are hopeful signs in the fight against inflation, with underlying price pressures subsiding. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting, but financial markets are betting on a rate cut in June.\n",

      "At its December 2024 meeting, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.25%, resulting in total rate cuts of 1.00% since September.\n",
      "The FOMC now projects just two interest rate cuts in 2025, compared to earlier projections of four rate cuts. Investors anticipate the Fed may pause interest rate cuts when it meets again in early 2025.\n",
      "For the third consecutive meeting, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed‚Äôs) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the federal funds target rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight lending. Following up on September‚Äôs 0.50% fed funds target rate cut, and November‚Äôs 0.25% cut, the FOMC at its December 2025 meeting cut rates by another 0.25%. The fed funds target rate is now set at 4.25% to 4.50%.\n",
      "The Fed held rates at 5.25% to 5.50% from July 2023 to September 2024. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Fed raised rates eleven times, from near 0%.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Federal Reserve, December 18, 2024.\n",
      "Notably, Fed officials, coming out of December‚Äôs meeting, appeared to scale back 2025 rate cut plans. The FOMC now projects just two 2025 rate cuts, compared to earlier projections of four rate cuts. ‚ÄúDecember‚Äôs Fed actions can be read as a hawkish cut,‚Äù says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management. ‚ÄúIt sets the market up to be ready for the Fed to go into a pause rather than set the stage for immediate additional rate cuts.‚Äù\n",
      "In a statement issued after December‚Äôs FOMC meeting, the Fed indicated that current economic data requires a policy balancing act. ‚ÄúRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace (2.8% in 2024‚Äôs third quarter).1 Since earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low (4.2% in November 2024).2 Inflation has made progress‚Ä¶but remains somewhat elevated (Personal Consumption Expenditures at 2.5% in November 2024),‚Äù1 read the statement.3 In his own comments, Powell stated that given the Fed‚Äôs recently initiated rate cuts, ‚Äúour policy stance is now significantly less restrictive. We can therefore be more cautious as we consider further adjustments to our policy rate.‚Äù4\n",
      "Along with the latest interest rate cut, the Fed continues, as it has since 2022, reducing its balance sheet of fixed income assets. At its peak, the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet grew to nearly $9 trillion dollars. Each month, the Fed trims its Treasury bond holdings, which now have declined to approximately $6.9 trillion.5 ‚ÄúIt seems unlikely the Fed will drop its balance sheet back to the $4 trillion level, as it stood in 2015-16, but given the extent the economy has grown since then, a larger Fed balance sheet may be justified,‚Äù says Haworth.\n",
      "Economy projected to stay on course\n",
      "After December 2024‚Äôs meeting, the FOMC issued its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), reflecting each FOMC member‚Äôs forward view on key economic variables. The SEP suggests most major economic measures are expected to show little change in 2025.6\n",

      "‚ÄúThe U.S. economy is just performing very, very well, substantially better than our global peer group,‚Äù says Powell. He sees little near-term recession risk.7\n",
      "‚ÄúThe Fed is seeing a lot of what they want in terms of economic data,‚Äù says Haworth. ‚ÄúInflation in general is slowing, except for recent upticks in food and energy, which are considered transitory. The job market remains healthy as well.‚Äù\n",
      "Markets react negatively to Fed policy\n",
      "In the immediate aftermath of the Fed‚Äôs policy statements, equity markets tumbled. Key indices such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite, and Russell 2000 all showed a one-day loss (on December 18) of 2.5% or more. It appeared to be a negative reaction to the Fed‚Äôs scaled-back rate cutting plans.\n",
      "Source: WSJ.com.\n",
      "Bond markets also declined. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped from 4.40% to 4.50% in a single day (bond prices fall when bond yields rise), representing its highest yield since May 2024. 2-year Treasury yields also experienced a similar change, rising from 4.25% to 4.35%.8\n",
      "The Fed‚Äôs Balancing Act\n",
      "The Fed‚Äôs primary purpose in raising rates and keeping them elevated was to combat the highest inflation since the early 1980s. At its peak, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), reached 9.1% for the 12 months ending in June 2022. The most recent CPI reading, for the 12 months ending in November 2024, showed inflation at a much improved 2.7%.2 However, over the most recent months, inflation moved modestly higher. ‚ÄúThere is a risk of a reacceleration of inflation,‚Äù says Haworth. ‚ÄúThe potential for added tariffs under the new Trump administration could add to that risk.‚Äù\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of November 30, 2024.\n",
      "At the same time, says Haworth, ‚ÄúThe Fed doesn‚Äôt want to see too much softness in the employment market.‚Äù That would contribute to a slowing economy. Although the nation‚Äôs unemployment rate moved above 4% in mid-2024, it has, in recent months, held steady.2\n",
      "‚ÄúDecember‚Äôs Fed actions can be read as a hawkish cut,‚Äù says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director with U.S. Bank Asset Management. ‚ÄúIt sets the market up to be ready for the Fed to go into a pause rather than set the stage for immediate additional rate cuts.‚Äù\n",
      "Haworth notes initial jobless claims provide a helpful ‚Äúreal-time‚Äù guide on the state of the jobs market. Claims held steady, but then in early December experienced a sudden uptick.9\n",

      "Where does the Fed go from here\n",
      "The policymaking FOMC meets next at the end of January 2025. Markets are expecting the Fed to hold the line on rates at that meeting, and possibly at its follow-up meeting in mid-March.10\n",
      "As the Fed continues to address monetary policy, be sure to consult with your financial professional and review portfolio positioning. Explore whether changes might be appropriate given your goals, time horizon and feelings toward risk in today‚Äôs evolving interest rate environment.\n",
      "Frequently asked questions\n",
      "What is monetary policy?\n",
      "Monetary policy is controlled by a nation‚Äôs central bank, which in the United States, is the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed‚Äôs management of monetary policy can have a significant impact on the shape of the nation‚Äôs economy. Congress‚Äô mandate for the Fed is to maintain price stability (manage inflation); promote maximum sustainable employment (low unemployment); and provide for moderate, long-term interest rates. Fed monetary policy influences the cost of many forms of consumer debt such as mortgages, credit cards and automobile loans.\n",
      "What is the Federal Reserve (Fed)?\n",
      "The Fed is the nation‚Äôs central bank, and perhaps the most influential financial institution in the world. The central governing board of the Federal Reserve reports to Congress, with the chair of the Federal Reserve appointed by the President. There are also 12 regional federal reserve banks that are set up like private corporations.\n",
      "Why does the Federal Reserve (Fed) raise or lower interest rates?\n",
      "The Federal Reserve‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target interest rate policy for the federal funds rate. This is the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend excess reserves to other banks on an overnight basis. The fed funds rate is raised or lowered usually to help impact underlying economic conditions. For example, in 2022, as inflation surged, the FOMC began raising interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and slow economic activity. That strategy was designed to ease pricing pressures and reduce the inflation rate. In periods when the economy is slow or in a recession, the Fed tends to lower rates to try to stimulate economic activity and help the economy expand again.\n",

      " Inflation and retail sales data greet a roaring stock market rally: What to know this week Josh Schafer ¬∑ Reporter Updated Mon, Nov 11, 2024, 3:04 AM 7 min read In This Article: META -0.94% ^SP600 +0.27% GOOG -1.30% MSFT -0.41% ^IXIC -0.89% Stocks just had their best week of 2024. All three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports. SNP - Delayed Quote ‚Ä¢ USD (^GSPC) Follow View Quote Details 5,937.34 - (-0.21%) At close: 4:45:19 PM EST ^GSPC ^DJI ^IXIC Advanced Chart Price check In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. \"We don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance,\" Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a \"core\" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. \"The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest,\" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. Retail reading The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales ‚Äî which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) ‚Äî is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%. Story Continues Disney on the big screen Disney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter. Streaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms. Shares are up about 9% this year. Trump trade lifts Big Tech In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) ‚Äî which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) ‚Äî hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off. Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft‚Äôs Satya Nadella, Meta‚Äôs Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a \"flight to quality\" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring. Small-cap resurgence Small caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years. It closed the week up more than 8% for its best week since April 2020 and is now closing in on its all-time high. This leaves investors with a question that's been prompted throughout 2024: With the Fed set to keep lowering interest rates, is now the time to pile into small caps? In a Friday webinar, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said not yet. The index has more short-term debt than the S&P 500 and would be a clear beneficiary of lower interest rates. But it also has another key difference from large-cap indexes right now: Earnings estimates aren't rising. While Kantrowitz's research shows 2024 full-year earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have increased over the last 90 days, earnings estimates for the small-cap S&P 600 (^SP600) index have been falling. \"In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower,\" Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. \"[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet,\" Kantrowitz said. \"So something we'll be monitoring.\" Weekly calendar Monday Economic data: No notable economic releases.

      "The current state of the US economy is characterized by rising consumer prices, driven by higher energy costs, and a Federal Reserve that is recalibrating its monetary policy in response to receding inflation. The Fed cut interest rates by 0.25% in December 2024, resulting in total rate cuts of 1.00% since September, and now projects just two interest rate cuts in 2025.

Watch now Key takeaways Inflation is down considerably from its mid-2022 peak of more than 9%. The Consumer Price Index rose modestly to 2.7% for the 12 months ending in November. In September and November, the Fed implemented interest rate cuts, with markets anticipating a December rate cut as well. For the 12-month period ending in November 2024, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7%. Although inflation trended modestly higher in October and November, the uptick is not considered significant, though further progress on reducing inflation appears to have stalled.1 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, November 2024. ‚ÄúOne factor worth watching is that inflation has stabilized at both the headline level and at the core level,‚Äù says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management. ‚ÄúAt the same time, the downward inflation trend we saw earlier seems to have disappeared.‚Äù When eliminating the volatile food and energy sectors, so-called ‚Äúcore‚Äù inflation remains higher than the broader CPI. The core inflation calculation still includes, among other categories, costs for housing, transportation and medical care. November‚Äôs inflation report showed core inflation growing by 3.3% over the previous 12 months, little changed since May 2024.1 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, November 2024. The biggest price changes in the past 12 months occurred in transportation services (+7.1%) and shelter (+4.7). By contrast, energy costs were 8.5% lower than a year ago while food prices rose just 2.4% over the same 12-month period.1 New inflation variables?
