      "1. Momentum Trading Strategy:\n",

      "- Mitigation Strategies: Implementing tight stop-loss orders to protect profits and limit losses. Continuously monitoring market trends and adjusting trading positions accordingly to avoid significant losses.\n",

      "2. Breakout Trading Strategy:\n",

      "- Potential Risks: Holding AAPL stock for a few days to weeks may expose the trader to market fluctuations and volatility, resulting in potential losses. Buying at support levels and selling at resistance levels may not always yield profitable trades.\n",
      "- Mitigation Strategies: Implementing trailing stop orders to secure profits and minimize losses in volatile market conditions. Conducting thorough analysis and using technical indicators to confirm support and resistance levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Day Trading Strategy:\n",
      "- Potential Risks: Buying and selling AAPL stock within the same trading day based on intraday market trends may result in emotional trading decisions and impulsive trades. Failing to adhere to strict risk management strategies may lead to consistent losses.\n",
